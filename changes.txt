TreeTank 4.17
-------------
+ Introduced Conventions for IAxis. Generic test case added to test all axis
  for convention compliance. Bug fixed with FullTextAxis.
+ BeanUtil now supporting remove().
+ Added readme.txt to provide authoritative coding conventions.
+ Added reset() to IAxis to allow for NestedAxis.
+ Switched to ISC License.
+ Replaced all axis classes performing tests to generic FilterAxis combined
  with IFilter.
+ Completely switched to unchecked exceptions.
 
TreeTank 4.16
-------------
+ WriteTransaction now threadsafe by enforcing single-writer contract.
+ Auto commit now default. User must no longer call commit. Auto commit
  commits after the modification of some nodes as well as before
  IWriteTransaction.close().
+ Idempotent close operation. Multiple calls do no longer hurt.
+ Added ID annotation for beans.
+ BeanUtil now serializing fields as attributes.
+ Added namespace and attribute getters to IReadTransaction.
+ Support wildcard suffix in FullTextAxis. It is activated by * as last
  character in token.
 
TreeTank 4.15
-------------
+ INode no longer part of public API; replaced by AbstractNode.
+ BeanUtil now supports byte[].
+ No longer make INode public. This lead to a variety of use cases mixing
  pure transaction cursor and node semantics. As a result, nobody really knew
  where the transaction cursor actually resided. These side-effects can be
  clearly avoided by a pure cursor-based approach.
+ Introduce concept of cursor stability: Always leave the cursor of a
  transaction where it was before calling a method except the method explicitly
  modifies the state of the transaction.
+ Moved bean-related stuff to beanlayer package.
+ Renamed UTF.convert() to UTF.getBytes([String|int]) 
  and UTF.parse[String|int](). Integer and Long methods are twice as fast and
  compatible to String.
+ BeanUtil now supporting boolean, int, long, float, double, and String.
+ Added FullText annotation to mark that Java bean field must be indexed.
+ Added BeanUtil to make Java beans persistent with TreeTank.
+ Added Session.removeSession() to safely remove a TreeTank file.

TreeTank 4.14
-------------
+ Added index() to IWriteTransaction. Note that this currently only makes
  the first occurrence available for later retrieval.
+ Added FullTextAxis to perform simple contains.
+ Added notion of reference key as multipurpose key.
+ Added lots of test cases.
+ Binary incompatibility because full text root node takes key 1.
+ Added hooks for full text index (inverted index based on prefix tree).
  (FullTextRootNode, FullTextNode, and FullTextLeafNode).
+ Session and transaction tracks close state to prevent access after close.
+ Allow multiple commit() and abort() calls before close().
+ Split IWriteTransaction semantics: now use [commit|abort]() AND close().
+ Fixed bug in axis classes performing tests.
+ Removed checked exceptions from IWriteTransaction exception for commit()
  which must throw an IOException in case the writing to the file failed.

TreeTank 4.13
-------------
+ Binary incompatibility to previous releases due to stored version info.
+ File now storing whether it is checksummed and encrypted.
+ File now storing the version number of TreeTank with which it was created.
+ Moved Axis classes to axislayer package.
+ Fixed bug with remove() in IWriteTransaction. Now also deleting
  descendants.
+ SAXGenerator bug fixed.
+ SAXGenerator now accepting IAxis as input for more convenience.
+ IAxis makes its transaction available to the public.
+ IAxis now public API and can be used instead of Iterable<INode>.
+ Made Node, Page, and Axis abstract and renamed them accordingly.
 
TreeTank 4.12
-------------
+ Added pagelayer and moved all nodes there.
+ Binary incompatibility to previous releases due to pagelayer changes.
+ IWriteTransaction now comes with insertElementAs... and insertTextAs...
+ Major rework of pagelayer. Node is split into Document, Element, and Text.
+ Add extended API of INode to IReadTransaction for convenience.
+ ISession tells absolute path, file name, and whether it is
  encrypted or checksummed.
 
TreeTank 4.11
-------------
+ Binary incompatibility to previous releases due to revision timestamp.
+ Optimized descendant algorithm.
+ Added timestamp to each revision.
+ Extended INode API for convenience.
+ INode can be bound to transaction for immediate node-based navigation.
+ Removed IAxisIterator and its implementations.

TreeTank 4.10
-------------
+ IReadTransaction move methods now immediately return INode.
+ Binary incompatibility to previous releases due to Page automatization.
+ Page replaces IPage to make pagelayer package code less error prone.
+ Safely switch between commits.
+ Session makes sure that there is only one session bound to some TreeTank
  file at any time.
 
TreeTank 4.9
------------
+ Deprecated IAxisIterator and its implementing classes.
+ Added AbstractAxis and its subclasses to support Java 5 enhanced for loops
  and iterators.
+ Renamed Session.getSession(...) to Session.beginSession(...).
+ Made sure that SessionConfiguration always binds to absolute path.
 
TreeTank 4.8
------------
+ Added changes.txt to document major changes in APIs and binary format.
