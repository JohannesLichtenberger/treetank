----------
+ TreeTankStream[Reader|Writer] - stable:
  Implementation of the XMLStream[Reader|Writer] interfaces of STaX.
  SAXGenerator will then be based on TreeTankStreamReader and
  SAXHandler on TreeTankStreamWriter.
  
+ Encrypted primary and secondary beacon - stable:
  The primary and secondary beacons currently are not encrypted.
  
+ XPathAxis - beta:
  XPath 2.0 implementation accepting all expressions that evaluate to a
  sequence of nodes (already) stored in TreeTank. This restriction is required 
  because of the IAxis interface.
