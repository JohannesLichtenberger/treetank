/**
<h1>Package Expr</h1>
     <p>
      Contains all high level XPath expressions.

    <p>
      Make sure to extend AbstractExpression for all expressions, that always 
      return a singleton, like logical, literal or quantifier expressions.
      For all other expression the AbstractAxis has to be extended.
