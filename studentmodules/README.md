Student Projects within Treetank
=============

Treetank acts as a base for multiple student projects. This bundle represents all student projects concluded within Treetank (former projects to the first iteration of the storage called idefix are not included).

The content is this bundles are not actively developed neither are they reviewed in detail. Adaptions to Treetank try to respect these bundles even though it cannot be guaranteed that this will always be the case.
