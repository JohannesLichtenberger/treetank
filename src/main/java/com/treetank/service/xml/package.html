    <h1>Package XML Layer</h1>
    <p>
    The package xml layer implements all axis iterations for the encoding
    implemented in the node layer. It also provides an adaptor for the
    saxon XPath/XQuery/XSLT reference implementation. Finally, it comes
    with SAX bindings required to shred an XML document or serialize one.
