    <h1>TreeTank Java Bean Binding</h1>
    <p>
    TreeTank can read and write Java POJOs that comply with the following
    conventions:
    <li>The java bean has the usual private fields accessible through getters
        and setters.</li>
    <li>The fields are of String, int, long, float, double, or boolean.</li>
    <li>There is a default constructor with no arguments. It is implicit if
        no constructor is implemented and must be made explicit as soon as
        there are other constructor accepting arguments.</li>
