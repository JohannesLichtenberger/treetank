TreeTank 4.21
-------------
4  Added keystore to service.
3  Moved to latest classpath 0.97.2; Removed backport-concurrent dependency.
2  Switched to IByteBuffer which is a variable-size ByteBuffer.
1  Switched from inlined to standalone attributes and namespace
   declarations.
0  No longer binary compatible. Switched to ByteBuffer.
 
TreeTank 4.20
-------------
8  Updated license to distinguish com.treetank and org.treetank packages.
7  Added XPath 2.0 implemented by Tina Scherer.
6  Changed compression ratio of deflate to 6.
5  Renamed IItem getValue to getRawValue as IItem always works with raw.
4  Added item list. Accessible through ISession.getReadTransaction(...).
3  Removed bean layer as web service is main target.
2  Names, types, and values are unified accessible by key, string, ar raw.
1  Removed type-specific encodings. Use external classes to encode types within
   byte arrays.
0  No longer binary compatible.
 
TreeTank 4.19
-------------
12 Fixed memory leak because the write transaction state is not properly closed
   during an intermediate auto commit.
11 Value types now int to fully support XMLSchema.
10 byte[] storing UTF-8 encoded String now also encodes internal predefined
   entities '&' and '<' to allow for XML-compliant byte-streaming.
 9 Added raw name methods to access the UTF-8-encoded byte[] underlying a name.
 8 Added XMLSerializer which is the most efficient way to serialize a subtree
   into an OutputStream. Required for web applications.
 7 Added ant task to generate JavaDoc.
 6 Added skeleton for TreeTankStream[Reader|Writer] implementing the
   XMLStream[Reader|Writer] interfaces of StAX.
 5 Fixed critical bug in TypedValue.atomize().
 4 Fixed critical bug in SAXGenerator emitting end elements too early.
 3 Renamed getRevisionSize() to getNodeCount() which is more expressive.
 2 Introduced transaction ID. This allows to close all open transactions during
   ISession.close().
 1 Fixed bug with NestedAxis.
 0 Local part and prefix are no longer stored separately but as qualified name.
   Binary incompatibility with 4.18.
 
TreeTank 4.18
-------------
11 Added var arg to FilterAxis to allow for multiple filters.
10 Fixed bug with cursor moving to attributes.
 9 SAXHandler now able to insert subtrees into an existing treetank.
 8 SAXGenerator now only accepting IReadTransaction. It will allways perform
   a descendant-or self step on the currently selected node.
 7 Include self option for ancestor and descendant axis.
 6 Fixed bug with auto commit being triggered too often.
 5 Reduced size of node and indirect pages to better support updates.
 4 Added convenience methods to IReadTransaction and IWriteTransaction to
   access typed values.
 3 Moved KEY, KIND, and TYPE constants to IReadTransaction.
 2 Renamed UTF to TypedValue. Use TypedValue.atomize() to get the String
   representation whatever type it is.
 1 Binary incompatibility with 4.17.
 0 Introducing value types to provide basic support for XMLSchema and XPath 2.0.
   This can, e.g., also be used to efficiently store an int instead of a
   String.
 
TreeTank 4.17
-------------
11 ISession now accepts maximum number of node modifications or elapsed
   seconds before auto commit. Auto commit must now be activated by 
   ISession.beginWriteTransaction(maxNodeCount, maxTime).
10 Introduced Conventions for IReadTransaction and IFilter. Bug fixed with
   IReadTransaction.moveTo(key).
 9 Moved IConstants to utils package. It should no longer be used publicly.
   Use IReadTransaction.isNullNodeKey(key) and getNullNodeKey().
 8 Refactored IReadTransaction. Move operations return true if the new node
   could be selected. If not, the cursor stays with the former node and false
   is returned.
 7 Refactored IFilter, added AbstractFilter not to pass transaction with each
   call to filter().
 6 Introduced Conventions for IAxis. Generic test case added to test all axis
   implementations for convention compliance. Bug fixed with FullTextAxis.
 5 BeanUtil now supporting remove().
 4 Added readme.txt to provide authoritative coding conventions.
 3 Added reset() to IAxis to allow for NestedAxis.
 2 Switched to ISC License.
 1 Replaced all axis classes performing tests to generic FilterAxis combined
   with IFilter.
 0 Completely switched to unchecked exceptions.
 
TreeTank 4.16
-------------
 6 WriteTransaction now threadsafe by enforcing single-writer contract.
 5 Auto commit now default. User must no longer call commit. Auto commit
   commits after the modification of some nodes as well as before
   IWriteTransaction.close().
 4 Idempotent close operation. Multiple calls do no longer hurt.
 3 Added ID annotation for beans.
 2 BeanUtil now serializing fields as attributes.
 1 Added namespace and attribute getters to IReadTransaction.
 0 Support wildcard suffix in FullTextAxis. It is activated by * as last
   character in token.
 
TreeTank 4.15
-------------
 9 INode no longer part of public API; replaced by AbstractNode.
 8 BeanUtil now supports byte[].
 7 No longer make INode public. This lead to a variety of use cases mixing
   pure transaction cursor and node semantics. As a result, nobody really knew
   where the transaction cursor actually resided. These side-effects can be
   clearly avoided by a pure cursor-based approach.
 6 Introduce concept of cursor stability: Always leave the cursor of a
   transaction where it was before calling a method except the method explicitly
   modifies the state of the transaction.
 5 Moved bean-related stuff to beanlayer package.
 4 Renamed UTF.convert() to UTF.getBytes([String|int]) 
   and UTF.parse[String|int](). Integer and Long methods are twice as fast and
   compatible to String.
 3 BeanUtil now supporting boolean, int, long, float, double, and String.
 2 Added FullText annotation to mark that Java bean field must be indexed.
 1 Added BeanUtil to make Java beans persistent with TreeTank.
 0 Added Session.removeSession() to safely remove a TreeTank file.

TreeTank 4.14
-------------
10 Added index() to IWriteTransaction. Note that this currently only makes
   the first occurrence available for later retrieval.
 9 Added FullTextAxis to perform simple contains.
 8 Added notion of reference key as multipurpose key.
 7 Added lots of test cases.
 6 Binary incompatibility because full text root node takes key 1.
 5 Added hooks for full text index (inverted index based on prefix tree).
   (FullTextRootNode, FullTextNode, and FullTextLeafNode).
 4 Session and transaction tracks close state to prevent access after close.
 3 Allow multiple commit() and abort() calls before close().
 2 Split IWriteTransaction semantics: now use [commit|abort]() AND close().
 1 Fixed bug in axis classes performing tests.
 0 Removed checked exceptions from IWriteTransaction exception for commit()
   which must throw an IOException in case the writing to the file failed.

TreeTank 4.13
-------------
 8 Binary incompatibility to previous releases due to stored version info.
 7 File now storing whether it is checksummed and encrypted.
 6 File now storing the version number of TreeTank with which it was created.
 5 Moved Axis classes to axislayer package.
 4 Fixed bug with remove() in IWriteTransaction. Now also deleting
   descendants.
 3 SAXGenerator bug fixed.
 2 SAXGenerator now accepting IAxis as input for more convenience.
 1 IAxis makes its transaction available to the public.
 0 IAxis now public API and can be used instead of Iterable<INode>.
   Made Node, Page, and Axis abstract and renamed them accordingly.
 
TreeTank 4.12
-------------
 5 Added pagelayer and moved all nodes there.
 4 Binary incompatibility to previous releases due to pagelayer changes.
 3 IWriteTransaction now comes with insertElementAs... and insertTextAs...
 2 Major rework of pagelayer. Node is split into Document, Element, and Text.
 1 Add extended API of INode to IReadTransaction for convenience.
 0 ISession tells absolute path, file name, and whether it is
   encrypted or checksummed.
 
TreeTank 4.11
-------------
 5 Binary incompatibility to previous releases due to revision timestamp.
 4 Optimized descendant algorithm.
 3 Added timestamp to each revision.
 2 Extended INode API for convenience.
 1 INode can be bound to transaction for immediate node-based navigation.
 0 Removed IAxisIterator and its implementations.

TreeTank 4.10
-------------
 4 IReadTransaction move methods now immediately return INode.
 3 Binary incompatibility to previous releases due to Page automatization.
 2 Page replaces IPage to make pagelayer package code less error prone.
 1 Safely switch between commits.
 0 Session makes sure that there is only one session bound to some TreeTank
   file at any time.
 
TreeTank 4.9
------------
 3 Deprecated IAxisIterator and its implementing classes.
 2 Added AbstractAxis and its subclasses to support Java 5 enhanced for loops
   and iterators.
 1 Renamed Session.getSession(...) to Session.beginSession(...).
 0 Made sure that SessionConfiguration always binds to absolute path.
 
TreeTank 4.8
------------
 0 Added changes.txt to document major changes in APIs and binary format.
